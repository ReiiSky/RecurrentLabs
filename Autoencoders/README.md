# Autoencoders

Library Versions:
- Python: 3.7.1
- Pytorch 1.0.0


There are two types of Autoencoders, undercomplete and overcomplete. Typically overcomplete autoencoders have more neurons in a hidden layer than the number of inputs/ouputs for the model. While having more nuerons in a hidden layer typically makes the model better, this is not help for us as autoencoder simple becomes copy function. What autoencoders are good for compressing or downsizing the data to a smaller dimensions.
